# Language Package Installation Plugin

Registers new language items.

## Components

!!! info "The `languagecode` attribute is required and should specify the [ISO-639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) language code."

The top level `<language>` node must contain a `languagecode` attribute.

### `<category>`

Each category must contain a `name` attribute containing two or three components consisting of alphanumeric character only, separated by a single full stop (`.`, U+002E).

#### `<item>`

Each language item must contain a `name` attribute containing at least three components consisting of alphanumeric character only, separated by a single full stop (`.`, U+002E). The `name` of the parent `<category>` node followed by a full stop must be a prefix of the `<item>`â€™s `name`.

!!! info "Wrap the text content inside a CDATA to avoid escaping of special characters."
!!! warning "Do not use the `{lang}` tag inside a language item."

The text content of the `<item>` node is the value of the language item. Language items that are not in the `wcf.global` category support template scripting.

## Example

{jinja{ codebox(
  title="language/en.xml",
  language="xml",
  filepath="package/pip/en.xml"
) }}
