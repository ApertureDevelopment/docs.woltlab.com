## Language Items

### Categories

If you install a category named `user.foo`, you have to provide the language item `wcf.acp.group.option.category.user.foo`, which is used when displaying the options.
If you want to provide an optional description of the category, you have to provide the language item `wcf.acp.group.option.category.user.foo.description`.
Descriptions are only relevant for categories whose parent has a parent itself, i.e. categories on the third level.

### Options

If you install an option named `user.foo.canBar`, you have to provide the language item `wcf.acp.group.option.user.foo.canBar`, which is used as a label for setting the option value.
If you want to provide an optional description of the option, you have to provide the language item `wcf.acp.group.option.user.foo.canBar.description`.
